# Meal planner for the indecisive

Ding is a full web-based meal planning application created by a team of four developers over a period of six weeks.
It utilizes PHP and a MySQL database on the back-end, and uses ReactJS mixed with Materialize and CSS3 on the front-end.

The app is designed to simplify the meal planning process and takes into account users diet and allergies when finding recipes.
